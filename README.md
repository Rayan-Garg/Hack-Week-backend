# Events App Backend

This is an API accessible at http://35.225.157.221/. It starts off with a default set of events and users can take actions such as creating events, adding users to events, and deleting an event entirely. More details are provided in the API specification.

## Installation

A demo of the frontend implemented using the backend can be viewed at the following link:
